# Contacts
Contacts is simple script designed to just let users add a contact name and phone number that is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 

To run the script just navigate to the `src` directory then download or copy the `main.rs` file. Then with Rust installed you can just run it with `rustc` or download the entire repository to build with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). 

This project was made when I finished chapter [6](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-03-method-syntax.html) in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) for practice.

This was the final result of a bigger idea that allowed users to edit and view the contacts but failed, so this is the final result.

Thank you for visiting this repository. ❤️
